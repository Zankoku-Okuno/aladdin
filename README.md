Aladdin
=======

Aladdin is an extensible, associative-memory-model assempbly language suitable for implementation in software. While originally conceived as component of the Lotus compiler interpreter, Aladdin is designed to be usefule as a drop-in module for any application that requires a custom virtual machine.

Features
========

 * Written in D for safe, fast, native execution.
 * Nested associative memory model removes the complexities of offset computation.
 * Instruction set architecture is extensible through user-written dynamic libraries.
 * Standardized D ABI allows wrapping into a number of other languages.
 * 100% branch coverage (hopefully) ensures reliability.

Requirements

* D compiler
