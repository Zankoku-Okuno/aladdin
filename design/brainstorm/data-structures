what's perfect-hashable?
	operation names (in fact, just translate to function pointers on load)
	labels (if they exist) must be present in the code text, so we can find all of them during load
	not addresses, since they can be computed arbitrarily at runtime

what's cacheable?
	addresses

addressing modes:
	immediate
	dereference
