 == Number ==
An arbitrary-precision signed integer. Logical operations use 2s-complement semantics.

 * Arithmatic Operations -- negate, add, subtract, multiply, divide (w/ remainder) (throws DivideByZero on division by zero)
 * Relational Operations -- lt, lte, eq, neq, gt, gte
 * Logical Operations -- invert, and, or, xor
 * Bitstring Operations -- arithmetic left/right shift, logical left shift, split, concatenate, rotate
 * TODO: Construct from source code text

 == Address ==
A string of Numbers and Labels. The user never interacts with labels except to write them into Aladdin source code.

 * Concatenate
 * Read/write referenced Datum -- throws UninitializedMemory on reading from uninitialized address
 * TODO: Construct from source code text

 == Datum ==
A Datum can be either a Number or an Address.

 * TODO: Expose interface to ALU -- type check operands, then delegate to Number or Address for actual computation

 == Memory Cell ==
Holds exacly one Datum and any number of Members. A Member is simply a memory cell with a fixed address relative to the cell in question. Members may be part of the cell's Array (indexed by Number first) or Block (indexed by Label first).

 * Dereference -- return the Datum held in the cell
 * Assign -- set the Datum held in the cell
 * Member -- using an input address, return the Member thereat
