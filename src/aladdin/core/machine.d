/*
 * This file contains only the AladdinMachine class, which unifies all the
 * storage and control components of the Aladdin Virtual Machine into a clean
 * interface.
 *
 * The control component of the VM exposes only methods to update the
 * instruction pointer. All other control is interior, but implemented here.
 *
 * The instruction and data memories are strictly separated. Allowing data-
 * driven modification of the code would complicate the data model beyond
 * reasonable limits. TODO In the future, support for dynamic loading, including
 * JIT compiling, may be supported.
 *
 * In case anyone was wondering where the ALU and I/O components of the VM are,
 * they have been delegated away. The ALU is accessed through the Datum class,
 * and no I/O operations are even directly considered for the VM. Plugins can
 * provide arbitrary code, such as serialization, communication with other
 * hardware, or even new data types and operations: in short, plugins are meant
 * to extend the VM's ALU and I/O capabilities, and possibly add new locations
 * and types of data storage.
